# 📝 Smart To-Do List

A prioritized Task Management application built with vanilla JavaScript. 
This project demonstrates DOM manipulation, Event Handling, and Local Storage persistence.

## 🚀 Features

* **Task Creation:** Users can add tasks with specific details.
* **Priority Logic:** Assign priority levels (High, Medium, Low).
* **Smart Sorting:** Tasks are automatically sorted by importance (High priority first).
* **Data Persistence:** Tasks are saved to the browser's Local Storage, so data is not lost on refresh.
* **Dynamic UI:** Color-coded tasks based on priority level.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **HTML5:** Semantic structure and Forms.
* **CSS3:** Flexbox layout and responsive styling.
* **JavaScript (ES6+):** Arrow functions, Array methods (`sort`, `splice`, `filter`), and JSON parsing.

## 💡 Lessons Learned

This project focused on strengthening core web fundamentals:
1.  **DOM Manipulation:** Creating and removing elements dynamically without page reloads.
2.  **State Management:** Using an array of objects as the "Single Source of Truth."
3.  **Algorithm:** Implementing a weighted sort algorithm to order tasks by non-numeric priority values.

## 🔮 Future Improvements

* [ ] Add "Edit Task" functionality.
* [ ] Connect to a Node.js/MongoDB backend for cross-device syncing.
